# the puzzle

::: lead
-   A large body of research shows people are deeply averse to unfairness and resistant to large economic gaps.

-   Yet inequality keeps rising worldwide —often tolerated, rarely contested.
:::

> **Why do people end up accepting the very inequalities they claim to oppose?**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# prevailing account

-   inequality is tolerated when it originates from a fair process (Starman 2017, *NHB*)

-   yet, opportunities are not equally distributes so, **why is still inequality tolerated?**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# prevailing account

-   limited awareness of systemic inequities

    -   misinformation (McCall 2017, *PNAS*; Sands 2019, *Nature*)
    -   biased belief systems reinforced by inequality itself—for example, through segregation (Newman 2015, *AJPS*; Mijs 2021, *SR*)

. . .

> **core assumption:** people would reject inequality if they were fully aware of unfair origins.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# a preview of what we find

<br>

evidence points to a **dual-track process of fairness evaluation**:

  - People rely on *moral judgment* to assess procedural fairness.

  - Their standards for acceptable disparities are *anchored in the level of inequality they experience*.

# study design {.center-slide}

# challenges

::::: columns
::: column
-   unfeasible to manipulate societal inequality in observational data.

-   experiments often manipulate arbitrary inequalities, triggering perceptions of unfairness (Starman 2017, *NHB*).

-   ➡️ we need *controlled* experiment that *resembles a real social environment*: 
    - individual are endowed with (un)equal opportunity
    - outcomes plausibly depend on individual choice 
    - (!) yet, the actual role of skill or effort must be controlled.

# experiment overview

-   pre-registered, interactive online card game ($N = 3,335$)

-   conducted on cloudresearch connect (US sample)

-   fully crossed 2×2×2 design:

    -   *opportunity inequality:* equal vs. opportunities **[details](#opportunity)**
    -   *outcome inequality:* low vs. high payoff gap  **[identification](#identification)**
    -   *social position:* winner vs. loser

-   several game features suggest skill matters, but outcomes are driven almost entirely by chance or rules **[tested](#talent)**

# experimental platform

::::: columns

two-player, 5-round game

-   each round, players receive *7 random tokens*

-   *exchange rules* before each round:

    -   random exchange = equal opportunity
    -   regressive exchange = unequal opportunity

-   overall winner/loser = most *rounds won*

-   payoffs: *payoff gaps* of \$2.5, (low inequality) or \$5 (high inequality).

# main takeaway

::: center
**Why do people accept (unfair) outcome inequalities if they reject inequality of opportunity ?**
:::

. . .

-   No need to assume limited awareness of unfairness

-   We document a dual-track process where:

. . .

::: key
> -   *Rejection of procedural unfairness:* Unequal opportunities are seen as less fair than equal opportunity, but the size of outcome inequality doesn’t affect fairness evaluations.
>
> -   *Normalization of inequality:* People anchor their evaluation of outcome inequality in what they experience; opportunity distribution doesn’t affect tolerance for disparities.
>
> -   *Personal consequences amplify effects:* Winners see more fairness, accept larger gaps, and credit talent—regardless of rules or results.

# discussion

-   provides microfoundations for the macro puzzle of persistent inequality.\
-   unifies cognition, fairness judgments, and stability of unequal arrangements.\

# outcome treatment {#indentification}

  - $Y_i$: outcome for individual $i$  
  - $\text{Position}_i \in \{\text{winner}, \text{loser}\}$: social position  
  - $\mathbb{I}^{\text{out}} \in \{\text{high}, \text{low}\}$: outcome inequality level  
  - $P_i \in \{\$10,\ \$7.5,\ \$5,\ \$2.5\}$: payment received by individual $i$  


**causal effect of outcome inequality:** $\mathbb{E}[Y \mid \mathbb{I}^{\text{out}}=\text{high},\ \text{Position}_i=p,\ P_i=p^*] -
\mathbb{E}[Y \mid \mathbb{I}^{\text{out}}=\text{low},\ \text{Position}_i=p,\ P_i=p^*]
$

- compares *same position* (winner/loser),  
- with *same payoff* $P_i = p^*$,  
- but different inequality levels (high vs. low).  

*earnings are fixed ⇒ differences reflect exposure to inequality only*
