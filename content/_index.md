## Bio
I’m an Assistant Professor in Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Previously, I was a Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow at the European University Institute and earned a Ph.D. in Sociology at Cornell University.

I study labor market inequalities, intergenerational mobility, and beliefs about inequality using statistical modeling, causal inference, experiments, and computational methods.

## Research & Methods (at a glance)
- Structural inequality: intergenerational mobility, labor-market gaps, educational assortative mating  
- Cultural facets: beliefs about inequality and fairness  
- Methods: Bayesian models (structured dispersion), log-linear models with Lasso, Monte Carlo simulation, large-scale online experiments
